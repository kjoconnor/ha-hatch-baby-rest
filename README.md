# Hatch Baby Rest for Home Assistant

This is super super WIP. Really the only thing that seems to work reliably is the switch on and off, something about the BLE stack on either Home Assistant or the Hatch device itself is flaky. I may be bombarding it with too many commands or something, but tough to say. Feel free to try it out yourself and see if you get better results, but I have disabled everything in HA besides the switch and that works for my needs.

Good luck!
